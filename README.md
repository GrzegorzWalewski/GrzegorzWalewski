Hi, I'm Grzegorz Walewski

# Who am I?
I'm **PHP programmer**. At free time I'm doing sports(mostly running). Last year I fell in love with tattoos, and got 3 of them :smile:
When I need relax, I play League of Legends with my friends. Sometimes I also watch some movies, but I wouldn't say im movie geek.
At "before COVID times" I was acting at local theater.

# What technologies I know?

As said before I'm PHP programmer, so PHP is my main language. For PHP I use Laravel, but (as u can see at my profile) I've made whole websites which shows that I also know js and css.
So, summarizing:

**1. Languages:**
  - PHP
  - JS
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - a little of Python
  - a little of Java
  
**2. With frameworks/libraries:**
  - Laravel
  - CodeIgniter
  - jQuery
  - Bootstrap
  - UiKit

# What project am I most proud of?
In my opinion best project I've ever made was [jaksmakowalo.pl](https://jaksmakowalo.pl/)
It's quite big. And I've made it public. It was first site I really worked on SEO. And above all every little change was giving me smile.
